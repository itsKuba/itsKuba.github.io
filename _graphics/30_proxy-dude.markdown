Experimental 3d isometric game development with Unity3d and C#. Turnbased gameplay with implemented controls, primitive enemy AI pathtracing, and collectibles for health/damage and score keeping. Obstacles and enemies are destructible, toughness is distinguished by color coding. Work in progress.<br />
